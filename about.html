               <p>I am an amatueur photographer in Raleigh, NC.  I spent years trying to find my artistic voice with drawing and painting, until friends started noticing pictures I took with my cell phone and shared on social media.  I was told over and over that I was a natural behind the camera. I didn't believe it at first, but experimented anyway.</p>   
              <p>I soon realized how photography was a huge confidence booster, and good for my soul.  It opened my eyes to the world and forced me to see beauty everywhere, and in some of the most unlikely things.</p>
               <p>I am a heart transplant survivor.  I received my gift on August 12, 2015.  Since then, photography takes on a whole different meaning for me.  The beauty that surrounds me somehow seems more beautiful.  I am grateful to be alive to experience beauty and to capture it and share it with the world.  My hope is to create art that would make my donor proud.  I don't just want to be alive.  I want to <strong>LIVE</strong>. I want to create beauty; To give something to the world as a "pay it forward" for getting my life back. </p>
               <p>I am also a proud co-parent with my husband to three spoiled cats, who are often in front of my camera.  My favorite subjects are animals and children.  You will see plenty of pictures of cats, nephews, and nieces.  But I enjoy taking pictures of just about anything.  If I find beauty in it, I will photograph it.</p>
